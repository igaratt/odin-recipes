    <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <h6>Pizza sauce</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA Tomato Paste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper </li>


    </ul>
    <h6>Pizza crust</h6>
    <ul>
        <li> ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed </li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® Yeast </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F) </li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil </li>


    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
