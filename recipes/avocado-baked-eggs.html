    <h4>Avocado Baked Eggs</h4>

    <p>I had these clever breakfast treats at a brunch gathering. They are easy to make for just two people or for a
        crowd. You can double or triple this recipe for a crowd. I use a muffin tin to hold each avocado half if I am
        making several of them</p> 

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>

    <ul>

        <li>1 avocado, halved and pitted </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup crumbled cooked bacon </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives </li>

    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place each avocado half in a ramekin. Crack 1 egg into each avocado half; season with salt, black pepper,
            and cayenne pepper. Place ramekins on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until entire egg is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle each avocado with
            bacon and chives.</li>


    </ol>
